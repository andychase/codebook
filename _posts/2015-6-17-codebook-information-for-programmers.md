Alternate codebook sub-titles:

 * The best ideas for programmers.
 * The essential guide to software and beyond.
 * Seminary for software ideology

This document serves to represent the basis for data in Codebook. It's called a *collection*, because it contains
text and data intermixed. It's in many ways like a page in the Codebook, which represents a set of helpful links,
discussions, data, arguments, etc from a particular person for a particular viewpoint.

Collections should stand on their own and provide structure and context to links you are submitting.


<div class="link_block" markdown="1">
<a href="stackoverflow.com/a/477578/3479853">The definitive guide to form-based website authentication</a>

This link is really helpful in its comprehensiveness in explaining the different
parts of username/password based authentication on the web.

Here's some sites that I use to gather fantastic thought-provoking programming articles and information:


<div class="link_block" markdown="1">
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions?sort=votes">StackOverflow Highest Voted Questions</a>
</div>

These resources are very interesting in getting a basis for what is popular and getting
a sense for what you should know as a software engineer.
