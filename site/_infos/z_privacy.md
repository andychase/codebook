# Privacy Policy


Preamble
========

This Master Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the collection,
use, and disclosure of “personal information” by Tech Store Club
(“TSC”), an Oregon Non-Profit organization.
Unless otherwise noted on a particular site or service, this Privacy
Policy applies to your use of all of the websites that Tech Store Club operates, including
<https://codebook.snc.io>, <https://techstore.club>, as well as the products,
information, and services provided through the Websites (the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to
our use and disclosure of non personal browsing and site usage data that
Tech Store Club collects as the provider of the Services. That
commitment is contained in a “Data Usage Policy,” below.

As used in this policy, “personal information” means information that
would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name,
address or location, telephone number, or email address.

By accessing or using any of the Services, you are accepting and
agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Our Principles
--------------

Tech Store Club is committed to handling responsibly the information
and data we collect about you through our Services, whether personal
information or non personal browsing and site usage data. We have
designed our Privacy Policy and our Data Usage Policy consistent with
the following principles (the “Principles”):

1.  Privacy policies and data collection and use policies should be
    human readable, comprehensive, and easy to locate;
2.  Only the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to
    provide you with services should be collected and maintained, and
    only for so long as reasonably needed or required;
3.  Information you provide through our Services, or that we gather as a
    result of your use of our Services, should not be used for marketing
    or advertising purposes, nor should it be provided voluntarily
    (without your permission) to anyone else unless required; and
4.  If Tech Store Club is required to provide a third party with your
    personal information (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then
    provided we have collected and retained an email address for you,
    Tech Store Club will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of
    that event, unless prohibited by law or TSC is otherwise advised
     not to notify you on the advice of legal counsel.

Personal Information TSC Collects
--------------------------------

We may collect personal information through our Services, including
without limitation:

-   when you donate money to us;
-   when you provide personal information in connection with your
    participation in any of the forums we make available through our
    Services.

What TSC Does with Personal Information
--------------------------------------

Donations. If you donate money to us via our
support page, your personal information will be handled depending on
which option you choose.

1.  You may donate money to Tech Store Club directly or through a
    variety of on-line payment sites, including PayPal, JustGive.org,
    Good Search, Network for Good, and Mission Fish, among others. When
    you use any of those websites and services to donate to TSC, your
    personal information is sent to, handled by and stored by those
    websites in accordance with their respective privacy policies and
    terms of use. You should read and understand the privacy policy and
    terms of use of any website you use to donate to Tech Store Club.
    When you donate money to Tech Store Club directly, we use your
    personal information to process your donation. When you donate money
    as part of one of TSC’s fundraising campaigns, your name will be
    published on our “supporters page” unless you request otherwise. If
    you sign up to receive updates from Tech Store Club
     when you provide your donation, we will use your personal
    information to send you communications about Tech Store Club news
    and campaigns.

Participating in Our Community
------------------------------

Registered Users. When you register to obtain a user account on any of
the Services (any such person, a “Registered User”),
you may be asked to provide personal information to create your account
and establish a password and profile. We encourage you to
 use an alias or nickname if you are not comfortable providing your
legal name. The name or nickname you provide in connection with your
account may be used to attribute you in connection with any content you
submit to any Service. We also use that personal information to
establish and maintain your account, to provide you with the features
 we provide Registered Users, and to email you regarding changes to this
policy or other applicable policies. If you sign up to receive updates
from Tech Store Club when you create your account, we will use your
personal information to send you communications about Tech Store Club
news and campaigns.

Any other personal information that we may collect which is not
described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and
used in accordance with the Principles.

Disclosures of Personal Information
-----------------------------------

In general, it is not Tech Store Club’ practice to disclose personal
information to third parties. Other than providing you with attribution
using your nickname in connection with your works, we
may share your personal information in two instances:

First, Tech Store Club may share personal information with our
contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add
to the functionality of the Services.

Second, we may disclose your personal information to third parties in a
good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a)
take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply
our Master Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal
process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or
(d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users,
affiliates, or the public.

If Tech Store Club is required to provide a third party with your
personal information (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then provided
we have collected and retained an email address for you, Creative
Commons will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event,
unless prohibited by law or TSC is otherwise advised not to
 notify you on the advice of legal counsel.

Security of Personal Information Collected via the Services
-----------------------------------------------------------

Tech Store Club has implemented reasonable measures to protect against
unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of
personal information that Tech Store Club stores and controls. However,
no website can fully eliminate security risks. Third parties may
circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access
transmissions or private communications. We will post a reasonably
prominent notice to the Websites if any such security breach occurs.


Data Usage Policy: Non Personal Browsing and Site Usage Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Data Usage Policy covers how we maintain and use information about
you that is collected by our Services, including when you log into a
website.

### Non Personal Browsing Information We Collect

When you use the Services, our servers (which may be hosted by a third
party service provider) may collect information indirectly and
automatically (through, for example, the use of your “IP address”) about
your activities while visiting the Websites and information about the
browser you are using. In addition, whenever you log into a website, our servers
(which may be hosted by a third party service provider) keep a
log of the websites you visit and when you visit them.

### No Selling or Sharing

Except in the unique situations identified in this Privacy Policy,
Tech Store Club does not sell or otherwise voluntarily provide the non
personal browsing information we collect about you or your website usage
to third parties.

### Notice

If Tech Store Club is required to provide a third party with your non
personal browsing information or to log in on behalf of a 
user (whether by subpoena or otherwise), then TSC will use
reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless TSC is
prohibited by law from doing so or is otherwise advised not to notify
 you on the advice of legal counsel.

Any other non-personal information that we collect which is not
described specifically in this Privacy Policy will only be collected and
used in accordance with the Principles.

Reorganization or Spin-Offs
---------------------------

Tech Store Club may transfer some or all of your personal and/or non
personal browsing information to a third party as a result of a
reorganization, spin-off, or similar transaction. Upon such transfer,
the acquirer’s privacy policy will apply. In such event, Creative
Commons will use reasonable efforts to notify you and to ensure that at
the time of the transaction the acquirer’s privacy policy complies with
the Principles.

Children
--------

The Services are not directed at children under the age of 13.
Consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy
 Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request
personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring
parental consent. Our Master Terms of Use specifically prohibit anyone
using our Services from submitting any personally identifiable
information about persons under 13 years of age. Any person who provides
their personal information to TSC through the Services represents that
they are 13 years of age or older.

Third-Party Sites
-----------------

The Services may include links to other websites. You should consult the
respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy
Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such
other websites.

Special Note to International Users
-----------------------------------

The Services are hosted in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Please note that your personal data may be  located on servers in the
United States and/or the United Kingdom. By providing your personal data
you consent to the use of your personal data for the uses identified
above in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------------------

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also
revise the Effective Date below. We encourage you to periodically review
this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the
personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Services
constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any
 updates.
