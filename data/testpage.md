Alternate codebook sub-titles:

 * The best ideas for programmers.
 * The essential guide to software and beyond.
 * Seminary for software ideology

This document serves to represent the basis for data in Codebook. It's called a *collection*, because it contains
text and data intermixed. It's in many ways like a page in the Codebook, which represents a set of helpful links,
discussions, data, arguments, etc from a particular person for a particular viewpoint.

Collections should stand on their own and provide structure and context to links you are submitting.

    This link is really helpful in its comprehensiveness in explaining the different
    parts of username/password based authentication on the web.

Here's some sites that I use to gather fantastic thought-provoking programming articles and information:

    [link/resource]
    title: StackOverflow Highest Voted Questions
    url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions?sort=votes

These resources are very interesting in getting a basis for what is popular and getting
a sense for what you should know as a software engineer.
