# What it is

Codebook is a new type of blog. Its goal is to be a comprehensive organization of computer science discussions and resources.

# How Codebook is written

The book is made up of *Collections* (this post is one) which is made up of *Resources*.
Collections are written as markdown documents, and resources are just indented snippets of (yaml)[yaml.org].

Here's an example resource:

book where software ideas can be explored and celebrated.
