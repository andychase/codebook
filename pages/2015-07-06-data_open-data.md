    description: >
        MusicBrainz started in 2000 by [Robert Kaye](http://mayhem-chaos.net/) who needed a place to store
        metadata files for the an unix cd player called Workman. Today MusicBrainz has metadata
        for 15 million records by almost a million artists worldwide
        ([Wikipedia Contributors, 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicBrainz)) 
        ([MusicBrains: About](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About/History)).
        
        MusicBrains has expanded their open data effort into [MetaBrains](https://metabrainz.org/)
        which also warehouses data for Music Cover Art, Music Criticism, and Books as well.
